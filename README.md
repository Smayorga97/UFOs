# UFOs
## Overview of the analysis:
the goal of this challenge and unit was to create a webpage that would let other people filter dataset of UFO sighting that are stored in a JavaScript document. The purpose was to build the webapage using HTML and CSS. The Website displays data that was given to students through out the unit.
## Results

## Summary
A drawback from this website is that the filters are not name "friendly" meaning that if someone who did not build the website searches for "Canada" instead of "ca", or also "CA" instead of "ca", they will not find the results.
Two recommendation for further development would be to fix the mentioned drawback by creating "if" conditions and it would also be ideal to change the colour of the table so the data can be better visualized(aesthetics)
